## Key Features

### Directive Enforcement
1. **Pre-Commit Checklist:** Requires searching for hardcoded values before committing
2. **Validation Labels:** Enforces "FOR VALIDATION ONLY" labeling
3. **Placeholder Warnings:** Requires "WARNING: PLACEHOLDER" comments
4. **Topological Origin:** All constants must trace to topology

### Automated Compliance
1. **PR Scanning:** Automatic checks on all pull requests
2. **Violation Reports:** Detailed JSON artifacts with file/line references
3. **PR Comments:** Formatted comments with actionable fixes
4. **Merge Blocking:** Critical violations prevent merge

### AI-Guided Review
1. **Gemini 3 Pro:** Advanced AI model for intelligent review
2. **Derivation Priority:** Always suggests topological derivations first
3. **Rule-Based Fallback:** Works without API key
4. **Inline Comments:** Posts review comments directly on code
5. **50K Context:** Large window for comprehensive analysis
