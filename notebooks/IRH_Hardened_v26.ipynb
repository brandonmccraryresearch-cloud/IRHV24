    "This notebook implements the mathematical transition from v25.0 (magic numbers) to v26.0 (topological invariants).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principle:** All physical constants must emerge from geometric functions (`np.pi`, `np.arccos(1/3)`, eigenvalues), not hardcoded experimental values.\n",

    "### **Constraint**\n",

    "This notebook documents exploratory calculations connecting topological structures to\n",
    "physical constants. Where rigorous derivations are incomplete, this is explicitly noted.\n",
    "The goal is transparent documentation of the derivation chain, including its limitations."
