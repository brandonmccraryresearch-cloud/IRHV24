    "### **Purpose**\n",
    "This notebook implements the mathematical transition from v25.0 (magic numbers) to v26.0 (topological invariants).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Principle:** All physical constants must emerge from geometric functions (`np.pi`, `np.arccos(1/3)`, eigenvalues), not hardcoded experimental values.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Contents**\n",
    "1. **Hopf Fibration Volume Ratio** - Fine-structure constant α from S³/S² volume ratios\n",
    "2. **Circulant Matrix Eigenvalue Analysis** - Koide ratio Q=2/3 from matrix eigenvalues\n",
    "3. **Braid Group Representation** - 8 gluons from B₃ braid group\n",
    "4. **Instanton Suppression** - Vacuum energy via e⁻ˢ calculation\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Constraint**\n",
    "**NO MAGIC NUMBERS:** Values like `137.036`, `0.666`, `1836.15` are FORBIDDEN as inputs.\n",
    "They may only appear as validation targets for comparison.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Methodology Notes**\n",
    "This notebook documents exploratory calculations connecting topological structures to\n",
    "physical constants. Where rigorous derivations are incomplete, this is explicitly noted.\n",
    "The goal is transparent documentation of the derivation chain, including its limitations."
