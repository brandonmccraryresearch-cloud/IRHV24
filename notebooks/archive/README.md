# Archived Notebooks - IRH v25/v26 Implementation

**Archive Date:** 2026-01-12

This directory contains the original computational validation notebooks for IRH theory versions 25 and 26. These notebooks have been retired in favor of new implementations using Gemini 3 Pro AI integration.

## Archived Notebooks

### Core Computational Notebooks (v25/v26)
1. **01_substrate_foundation.ipynb** - 4-strand architecture and metric mismatch derivation
2. **02_harmony_functional.ipynb** - Fine-structure constant (α) from Hopf fibration
3. **03_particle_sector.ipynb** - Koide formula and lepton mass relationships
4. **04_cosmology.ipynb** - Vacuum energy and cosmological constant
5. **05_gauge_sector.ipynb** - SU(3) gauge symmetry from braid groups
6. **06_validation_suite.ipynb** - Comprehensive Tier 1-3 validation
7. **07_appendices.ipynb** - Mathematical refinements (knot complexity, RG flow)

### Supplementary Notebooks
- **IRH_Hardened_v26.ipynb** - Consolidated v26 theory hardening

## Archive Reason

These notebooks are being archived to make way for:
- **IRH v57** - Latest theory version with enhanced mathematical framework
- **Gemini 3 Pro Integration** - AI-powered self-examination and theory refinement
- **Enhanced Computational Tools** - New generation of validation notebooks

## Historical Validation Results

The archived notebooks successfully validated:
- ✅ Fine-structure constant α⁻¹ within experimental bounds
- ✅ Koide formula for lepton masses (>99% accuracy)
- ✅ Cosmological constant suppression (10¹²³ → observable value)
- ✅ SU(3) color charge from topological invariants
- ✅ Overall Tier 1 validation: >90% of parameters within 3σ bounds

## Accessing Archived Notebooks

To run these notebooks:
```bash
conda env create -f ../../environment.yml
conda activate irh-compute
jupyter lab
```

Then navigate to this archive directory and open any notebook.

**Note:** These notebooks remain available for reference and comparison purposes. They represent a complete implementation of IRH computational validation as of version 26.0.
