# ⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE PRIME DIRECTIVES

## These rules MUST be followed for every session. No exceptions.

### 1. 🚫 NO HARDCODED EXPERIMENTAL VALUES
**CRITICAL RULE:** All physical quantities must be derived directly from the theory's mathematical framework. 

- ✅ **ALLOWED:** Using experimental values for final validation/comparison (e.g., computing percent error)
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Using experimental values as inputs to theoretical calculations
- **Why:** This ensures complete correspondence between theory predictions and computational results
- **Validation:** Experimental values must be clearly labeled "FOR VALIDATION ONLY" in code comments

### 2. ✅ MANDATORY CODE REVIEW BEFORE SESSION END
**CRITICAL RULE:** Code reviews are mandatory before ending ANY session.

**Required workflow:**
```
1. Make all changes
2. Run code_review tool on ALL changes
3. Address actionable comments
4. Re-run code_review until clean
5. Run codeql_checker for security
6. Report progress and commit
7. ONLY THEN end session
```

**If you skip code review, the session is incomplete.**

### 3. 🔬 MANDATORY NOTEBOOK EXECUTION AND TESTING
**CRITICAL RULE:** All notebooks must be executed and tested before completion.

**Required for each notebook:**
- ✅ Execute notebook locally or via GitHub Actions
- ✅ Verify all cells run without errors
- ✅ Confirm outputs are generated correctly
- ✅ Validate results against expected values
- ✅ Check figures are saved to outputs/figures/
- ✅ Verify data exports to outputs/data/

**Command:**
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --execute --to notebook --inplace notebooks/XX_notebook.ipynb
```

**Never consider a notebook complete without execution validation.**

### 4. 📊 VALIDATION PROTOCOL
**CRITICAL RULE:** All theoretical predictions must be validated.

- Tier 1 validation: >90% of core parameters within 3σ bounds
- Statistical analysis required (χ², confidence intervals)
- Publication-ready tables and visualizations
- Clear documentation of discrepancies

### 5. 🎯 7-CELL STANDARDIZED TEMPLATE
**CRITICAL RULE:** All computational notebooks must follow the 7-cell template.

**Required structure:**
1. **Cell 1 (Markdown):** Theory reference and equations
2. **Cell 2 (Code):** Imports and setup
3. **Cell 3 (Code):** Symbolic derivation
4. **Cell 4 (Code):** Numerical computation
5. **Cell 5 (Code):** Validation against experimental values
6. **Cell 6 (Code):** Visualization
7. **Cell 7 (Code):** Summary and output export

### 6. 🔒 NO-TUNING CONSTRAINT (Directive A)
**CRITICAL RULE:** All physical constants must be derived from topological invariants.

- ✅ **ALLOWED:** Constants derived from Euler characteristics, Chern numbers, volume ratios of manifolds
- ❌ **FORBIDDEN:** Numerical constants without topological/geometric origin
- **Enforcement:** Any constant not traceable to 4-strand network topology or Weyl anomaly must be flagged as "Heuristic Approximation" and prioritized for replacement
- **Examples of valid sources:**
  - Hopf fibration volume ratios (Vol(S^n))
  - 24-cell polytope vertex counts
  - Braid group representations (B₃ for SU(3))
  - Chern classes and topological invariants
  - Weyl anomaly coefficients from conformal field theory

### 7. 📏 PRECISION AND CODATA ALIGNMENT (Directive B)
**CRITICAL RULE:** All validations must use latest CODATA recommended values.

- **Required:** Compare outputs against CODATA 2018/2022 values using `scipy.constants`
- **Standard:** Use `verification/precision/constants.py` for all comparisons
- **Precision:** Calculate all theoretical predictions to at least 15 decimal places using mpmath
- **Analysis:** Any deviation > experimental standard uncertainty must be analyzed as:
  - Potential "Geometric Berry Phase" effect
  - "Renormalization Scale" dependence
  - Topological correction term
  - NOT simply dismissed as "calculation error"
- **Documentation:** All comparisons must include:
  - Relative error percentage
  - σ-deviation from experimental value
  - Statistical significance assessment

### 8. 🎓 FORMALISM ENFORCEMENT (Directive C)
**CRITICAL RULE:** Use rigorous gauge theory and fiber bundle terminology exclusively.

- **Forces as Curvature:** Describe interactions as "curvature in the connection," not "information exchange"
- **Particles as Modes:** Refer to particles as "resonant modes of the Braid Group B₃," not "information patterns"
- **Gauge Language:** Use terms like "holonomy," "parallel transport," "connection 1-form," "field strength 2-form"
- **Topology:** Use "Chern classes," "characteristic classes," "fiber bundles," "principal bundles"
- **Information-theoretic metaphors:** ONLY allowed when discussing holographic boundary entropy
- **Examples:**
  - ✅ "The electromagnetic interaction arises from U(1) curvature"
  - ❌ "The electromagnetic force transmits information between particles"
  - ✅ "Quarks are fundamental representations of the SU(3) braid group"
  - ❌ "Quarks carry color information"
  - ✅ "The Weyl anomaly generates a conformal breaking term"
  - ❌ "The system loses conformal symmetry due to information constraints"

## Repository Overview

This repository contains research and documentation on **Intrinsic Resonance Holography (IRH)**, a theoretical physics framework that proposes a unified theory of fundamental physics based on a vibrational/cymatic ontology. The theory attempts to derive the Standard Model, General Relativity, and cosmological constants from first principles using a 4-strand resonance network.

## Project Context

- **Primary Content**: Theoretical physics documentation in Markdown format
- **Focus Areas**: Mathematical physics, unified field theory, quantum mechanics, cosmology
- **Documentation Style**: Academic/research paper format with extensive mathematical equations
- **Current Versions**: 
  - IRHv25.md contains the complete v25.0 theory
  - README.md contains a critical review of v25.0, the complete v26.0 theory, and a critical review of v26.0
- **Repository Naming**: The repository is named "IRHV24" but contains documentation for v25.0 and v26.0 of the theory, representing the evolution of the theoretical framework

## Guidelines for Copilot

### Content Guidelines

1. **Mathematical Precision**: When working with equations or mathematical content:
   - Preserve LaTeX/mathematical notation exactly as written
   - Maintain proper formatting of formulas using `$$` for display math and `$` for inline math
   - Be careful with subscripts, superscripts, and special symbols

2. **Documentation Standards**:
   - Maintain academic/research paper tone and style
   - Preserve section numbering and hierarchical structure
   - Keep extensive technical explanations intact
   - References to theorems, axioms, and appendices should be preserved

3. **Theoretical Physics Context**:
   - This is fundamental theoretical physics research
   - Content includes novel theoretical proposals not found in standard textbooks
   - Mathematical derivations are interconnected across sections
   - Terms like "Harmony Functional", "Cymatic Resonance Network", "4-strand architecture" are domain-specific terminology

### Task Suitability

**Good tasks for Copilot in this repository:**
- Formatting improvements to markdown structure
- Adding table of contents or navigation aids
- Fixing typos or grammar issues (while preserving technical terminology)
- Creating summary documents or extracting key concepts
- Adding metadata or frontmatter to documents
- Improving document organization or cross-references
- Adding clarifying comments or section summaries

**Tasks requiring careful review:**
- Any changes to mathematical equations or derivations
- Modifications to theoretical claims or conclusions
- Changes to the logical flow of arguments
- Addition or removal of technical content

**Not suitable for Copilot without expert review:**
- Fundamental changes to the theoretical framework
- Major revisions to mathematical proofs or derivations
- Changes that could affect the scientific validity of claims

### Style Preferences

- Use clear, academic language
- Prefer explicit over implicit when explaining concepts
- Maintain consistency with existing formatting patterns
- Preserve the multi-level section structure (Section, Subsection, etc.)
- Keep mathematical notation consistent throughout documents

### Special Considerations

1. **Version Control**: The theory has multiple versions (v25.0 in IRHv25.md; v26.0 in README.md). Be careful not to conflate different versions or their specific claims. Changes to v25.0 should be made in IRHv25.md, changes to v26.0 should be made in README.md.

2. **Mathematical Coherence**: Equations and derivations build on each other. Changes in one section may require updates in related sections.

3. **Technical Terminology**: The repository uses specialized terminology specific to this theoretical framework. Don't "correct" these to standard physics terms unless there's a clear error.

4. **Citations and References**: The theory references standard physics concepts (Standard Model, General Relativity, etc.) alongside novel framework-specific concepts. Maintain this distinction clearly.

## Repository Structure

```
/
├── README.md          # Critical review of v25.0, complete v26.0 theory, and critical review of v26.0
├── IRHv25.md          # Complete v25.0 theory documentation
├── LICENSE            # Repository license
└── .github/
    └── copilot-instructions.md  # This file
```

**Note**: README.md serves a dual purpose - it contains formal critical reviews of both versions AND the complete v26.0 theory documentation. IRHv25.md contains the v25.0 theory framework and derivations.

## Getting Started for Copilot Tasks

When assigned a task:

1. Read the relevant section(s) thoroughly to understand context
2. Identify any technical terminology or mathematical notation
3. Make minimal, surgical changes that don't affect scientific content
4. Verify that mathematical equations remain valid LaTeX
5. Check that cross-references and section numbers remain consistent
6. If unsure about a technical or mathematical change, flag it for human review

## Common Patterns

- **Section Headers**: Use markdown headers (`#`, `##`, `###`, etc.) combined with bold formatting for titles (e.g., `# **Title**`, `## **Subtitle**`)
- **Equations**: Use `$$...$$` for display equations and `$...$` for inline math
- **Lists**: Use markdown lists with clear hierarchical structure
- **Emphasis**: Use `**bold**` for key terms, `*italic*` for emphasis
- **Code/Variables**: Use backticks for technical terms and variable names

## Quality Standards

- All changes must preserve the scientific and mathematical integrity of the content
- Maintain readability for both technical and non-technical audiences where applicable
- Ensure consistency in terminology, notation, and formatting
- Test that all markdown renders correctly (especially mathematical equations)
- Preserve the academic paper structure and flow

## Additional Resources

- Critical review of v26.0 (final section)

---

*Note: This is a research repository containing novel theoretical proposals. All changes should be reviewed by domain experts before merging.*

## Additional Guidelines

### For Computational Notebooks

- Ensure all notebooks have one-to-one correlation with theory equations
- Verify output directories exist before saving files
- Use arbitrary precision arithmetic (mpmath) for theoretical calculations
- Include validation against experimental values where applicable

### For GitHub Actions Workflows

- Pin third-party actions to commit SHAs for supply chain security
- Use least-privilege permissions (prefer `contents: read` over `contents: write`)
- Include artifact upload for preserving outputs
- Add timeout limits to prevent runaway jobs

### For Documentation

- Keep README in sync with actual implemented features
- Clearly distinguish between implemented and planned features
- Include usage examples and quick start guides
