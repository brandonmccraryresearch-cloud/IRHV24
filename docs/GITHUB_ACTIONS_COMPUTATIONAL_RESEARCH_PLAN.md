# GitHub Actions Computational Research Plan

## Overview

This document provides a comprehensive research plan for using GitHub Actions workflows to run full-scale computational validation of the **Intrinsic Resonance Holography (IRH)** theoretical framework. The goal is to create executable Python/Jupyter notebooks that correspond one-to-one with each section of the theoretical framework.

---

## 1. GitHub Actions Computational Capabilities

### 1.1 Runner Specifications

GitHub-hosted runners provide the following computational resources:

| Resource | Ubuntu Runner | Windows Runner | macOS Runner |
|----------|--------------|----------------|--------------|
| **vCPUs** | 4 cores | 4 cores | 3 cores (M1: 4) |
| **RAM** | 16 GB | 16 GB | 14 GB |
| **Storage** | 14 GB SSD | 14 GB SSD | 14 GB SSD |
| **Architecture** | x86_64 | x86_64 | ARM64 (M1) |

**For IRH computations**: Ubuntu runners are recommended due to:
- Best compatibility with scientific Python stack
- Fastest startup time
- Native support for NumPy, SciPy, SymPy acceleration

### 1.2 Job Time Limits

- **Default timeout**: 6 hours per job
- **Maximum configurable**: 72 hours (using `timeout-minutes`)
- **Free tier limits**: 
  - Public repos: Unlimited minutes
  - Private repos: 2,000 minutes/month (Pro), 3,000 minutes/month (Team)

### 1.3 Computational Libraries Available

GitHub Actions runners come with pre-installed:
- Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12
- pip, pipenv, poetry
- NumPy, SciPy (via apt)
- Miniconda/Anaconda (via setup action)

---

## 2. Anaconda/Miniconda Workflow Setup

### 2.1 Recommended Approach: `setup-miniconda` Action

The official `conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3` action provides:
- Full Anaconda ecosystem support
- Conda environment caching
- mamba solver for fast dependency resolution

### 2.2 Environment Configuration

Create a dedicated `environment.yml` for IRH computations:

```yaml
name: irh-compute
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - python=3.11
  - numpy>=1.24
  - scipy>=1.11
  - sympy>=1.12
  - matplotlib>=3.7
  - jupyter>=1.0
  - nbconvert>=7.0
  - pandas>=2.0
  - mpmath>=1.3        # Arbitrary precision arithmetic
  - numba>=0.57        # JIT compilation for performance
  - networkx>=3.1      # Graph theory for CRN simulations
  - scikit-learn>=1.3  # ML for pattern recognition
  - pip:
    - qutip>=5.0                 # Quantum toolbox for braid group calculations
    - spherical-functions>=2022.4.5  # Spherical harmonics (Hopf fibration)
```

### 2.3 Mamba Solver (Recommended)

Use `mamba` instead of `conda` for 10-100x faster dependency resolution:

```yaml
- uses: conda-incubator/setup-miniconda@v3
  with:
    miniforge-version: latest
    activate-environment: irh-compute
    environment-file: environment.yml
    use-mamba: true
```

---

## 3. Network Access and Firewall Configuration

### 3.1 Default Network Access

GitHub Actions runners have:
- **Full outbound internet access** by default
- No firewall restrictions for package downloads
- Access to PyPI, conda-forge, GitHub, etc.

### 3.2 Enabling Enhanced Network Access (Copilot Agent Sessions)

When running computations via GitHub Copilot Coding Agent sessions:

**Option to Enable**: In your repository settings:
1. Go to **Settings** → **Copilot** → **Policies**
2. Enable **"Allow Copilot to access external network resources"**

This allows the agent to:
- Download packages from PyPI/conda-forge
- Fetch external data
- Access web APIs

### 3.3 Self-Hosted Runners (For Heavier Computation)

For computations exceeding 6 hours or requiring more resources:

```yaml
runs-on: [self-hosted, linux, x64]
```

Self-hosted runners allow:
- Custom hardware (GPUs, high RAM)
- Persistent environment caching
- No time limits

---

## 4. Workflow Configuration for IRH Computations

### 4.1 Complete Workflow File

The workflow file `.github/workflows/irh-compute.yml` provides:

1. **Trigger Options**:
   - `workflow_dispatch`: Manual trigger with parameters
   - `push`: Automatic on code changes
   - `schedule`: Periodic validation runs

2. **Matrix Strategy** for parallel execution:
   - Run multiple notebook sections simultaneously
   - Test across Python versions

3. **Artifact Management**:
   - Save computed outputs
   - Generate downloadable reports
   - Cache environments for speed

### 4.2 Key Workflow Features

```yaml
# Enable manual triggering with inputs
on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      section:
        description: 'Theory section to compute (1-6, or "all")'
        required: true
        default: 'all'
```

## 5. Notebook Structure for IRH Theory Validation

### 5.1 One-to-One Correlation Requirement

Each notebook must:
1. Clearly reference the exact equation from IRHv25/v26
2. Implement the mathematical computation
3. Display both symbolic and numerical results
4. Validate against expected values
5. Include inline LaTeX matching the theory

### 5.2 Proposed Notebook Structure

| Notebook | Theory Section | Key Computations |
|----------|---------------|------------------|
| `01_substrate_foundation.ipynb` | Section 1: Ontological Foundation | 4-strand stability, N=4 derivation |
| `02_harmony_functional.ipynb` | Section 2: Mathematical Engine | α derivation, metric mismatch η=4/π |
| `03_particle_sector.ipynb` | Section 3: Harmonic Crystallization | Higgs VEV, Koide formula |
| `04_cosmology.ipynb` | Section 4: Holographic Hum | Λ derivation, dark matter ratio |
| `05_gauge_sector.ipynb` | Section 5: Coherence Connections | SU(3)×SU(2)×U(1) emergence |
| `06_validation_suite.ipynb` | Section 6: Computational Validation | Tier 1-3 protocols |
| `07_appendices.ipynb` | Appendices A-E | Formal derivations |

### 5.3 Notebook Template Structure

Each notebook follows:

```python
# Cell 1: Theory Reference
"""
## [Section X]: [Title]
### Corresponding IRH v26.0 Reference: [Exact Section]

**Equation being validated:**
$$
[LaTeX equation from theory]
$$
"""

# Cell 2: Imports and Setup
import numpy as np
from sympy import *
# ...

# Cell 3: Symbolic Derivation
# Reproduce the mathematical derivation step-by-step

# Cell 4: Numerical Computation
# Calculate numerical values

# Cell 5: Validation
# Compare to known values and theory predictions

# Cell 6: Visualization
# Plot results with annotations

# Cell 7: Output Summary
# Structured output for paper inclusion
```
