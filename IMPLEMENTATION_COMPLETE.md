## Phase 1: Enhanced Directive Enforcement ✅

### Files Modified:
- `.github/agents/irh-computational-research.agent.md` (major update)

### Implementation Details:

Added comprehensive **NON-NEGOTIABLE OPERATIONAL PARAMETERS** section at the top of agent instructions with:

#### DIRECTIVE A: ABSOLUTE NO-TUNING CONSTRAINT
- **Forbidden practices:** Hardcoded experimental values as inputs, back-solving, phenomenological fitting
- **Required practices:** All constants from topological invariants, experimental values only for validation
- **Pre-commit checklist:** Search for hardcoded constants, verify topological origin, proper labeling
- **Examples:** Both violation and compliant code patterns
- **Label format:** `# EXPERIMENTAL VALUE - FOR VALIDATION ONLY`
- **Placeholder format:** `# WARNING: PLACEHOLDER - Topological derivation pending`

#### DIRECTIVE B: CODATA PRECISION REQUIREMENT
- Minimum 15 decimal places using mpmath
- σ-deviation analysis mandatory
- Comparison to CODATA 2018/2022 values
- Implementation examples with scipy.constants

#### DIRECTIVE C: RIGOROUS FORMALISM ENFORCEMENT
- Forces = "curvature in gauge connection"
- Particles = "resonant modes of Braid Group B₃"
- Forbidden: Information-theoretic metaphors (except holographic boundary)
- Examples of correct vs. incorrect terminology

#### Session Protocols
- **Initialization Protocol:** Review directives, acknowledge constraints, plan approach, identify violation points
- **Completion Protocol:** Search for hardcoded values, verify labels, check placeholders, run automated checks

### Testing:
✅ Agent instructions successfully updated  
✅ Directives are clear, comprehensive, and prominently displayed  
✅ Examples provided for both violations and compliant code

---

## Phase 2: Automated Code Review Workflow ✅

### Files Created:
- `scripts/check_directive_compliance.py` (17KB, executable)
- `.github/workflows/agent-directive-check.yml` (8KB)

### Implementation Details:

#### Compliance Checker Script
**Language:** Python 3.11+  
**Dependencies:** nbformat (for Jupyter notebook parsing)  
**Features:**
- Detects 20+ experimental value patterns (α, electron mass, Planck constant, etc.)
- Checks for proper validation labels in code and nearby comments
- Verifies placeholder warnings (TODO, FIXME, etc.)
- Parses both Python files and Jupyter notebooks
- Generates detailed JSON violation reports
- Returns exit code 1 for critical violations

**Command-line Interface:**
```bash
python check_directive_compliance.py \
    --check-hardcoded-values \
    --check-experimental-labels \
    --check-placeholder-warnings \
    --paths notebooks/ scripts/ verification/ \
    --output violations.json
```

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "total_violations": 2,
  "critical_violations": 2,
  "warning_violations": 0,
  "violations": [
    {
      "file": "path/to/file.ipynb",
      "line": 1020,
      "value": "137.036",
      "context": "Fine-structure constant α⁻¹",
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "message": "Hardcoded experimental value without validation label",
      "code_snippet": "alpha = 1/137.036"
    }
  ]
}
```

#### GitHub Actions Workflow
**Triggers:**
- Pull requests (opened, synchronize, ready_for_review)
- Manual workflow_dispatch

**Features:**
- Checks changed files in PRs automatically
- Uploads violation report as artifact (30-day retention)
- Posts detailed comment on PR with violation summary
- Blocks merge if critical violations found
- Security: Pinned action versions, minimal permissions

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Checkout code with full history
2. Set up Python 3.11
3. Install dependencies (nbformat)
4. Determine paths to check (PR diff or manual input)
5. Run compliance checker
6. Upload artifact if failures found
7. Parse violations and format PR comment
8. Post comment with actionable fixes
9. Fail job if critical violations detected

### Testing:
✅ Compliance checker successfully detects violations in test notebook  
✅ JSON report generated correctly  
✅ Exit codes work as expected (0 for clean, 1 for critical)  
✅ Workflow YAML is valid and ready for PR testing

**Test Results:**
```
Tested on: notebooks/02_harmony_functional.ipynb
Found: 2 critical violations (hardcoded α without labels)
Output: /tmp/test_violations.json (valid JSON)
Exit code: 1 (correct for critical violations)
```

---

## Phase 3: AI-Guided Review Integration ✅

### Files Created:
- `scripts/gemini_review.py` (17KB, executable)
- `.github/workflows/gemini-review.yml` (12KB)

### Implementation Details:

#### Gemini Review Script
**Language:** Python 3.11+  
**Dependencies:** google-generativeai (optional, has fallback)  
**Features:**
- Loads directive constraints from agent instructions
- Analyzes PR diffs using GitHub CLI or git commands
- Uses Gemini 3 Pro for intelligent code review (if API key available)
- Falls back to rule-based analysis if Gemini unavailable
- **Priority:** Always suggests derivation paths over failure admission
- Generates actionable fix recommendations with suggested code
- Outputs JSON with issues, severity levels, and fix suggestions

**Command-line Interface:**
```bash
python gemini_review.py \
    --pr-number 42 \
    --directives .github/agents/irh-computational-research.agent.md \
    --focus-areas "hardcoded values,experimental inputs,placeholder implementations" \
    --output review_results.json
```

**AI Prompt Strategy:**
- Loads full directive text (A, B, C)
- Analyzes code diff (up to 8000 chars)
- Instructs AI to suggest topological derivations
- Forbids "acknowledge limitation" as primary fix
- Requests JSON output with structured issues

**Fallback Rule-Based Analysis:**
When Gemini API unavailable:
- Pattern matching for experimental values (137.03x, 0.511, etc.)
- Detection of information-theoretic metaphors
- Basic violation categorization
- Ensures script always works, even without API

**Output Format:**
```json
{
  "pr_number": 42,
  "total_issues": 3,
  "critical_count": 1,
  "warning_count": 2,
  "has_critical": true,
  "issues": [
    {
      "file": "notebooks/02_harmony_functional.ipynb",
      "line": 42,
      "severity": "CRITICAL",
      "message": "Hardcoded experimental value α = 1/137.036 used as input",
      "violation_type": "DIRECTIVE_A_HARDCODED_VALUE",
      "fix_required": "Derive α from Hopf fibration volume ratios...",
      "suggested_code": "volume_S7 = (np.pi**4) / 24\n..."
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Gemini Review Workflow
**Type:** Reusable workflow (workflow_call) + manual workflow_dispatch  
**Triggers:**
- Called by other workflows with PR number and session ID
- Manual dispatch for ad-hoc reviews

**Inputs:**
- `pr_number`: Pull request to review (required)
- `session_id`: Agent session ID for tracking (required for workflow_call)
- `focus_areas`: Comma-separated focus areas (optional)

**Outputs:**
- `has_critical`: Boolean indicating critical issues
- `issue_count`: Total number of issues found

**Features:**
- Installs Gemini SDK if API key available
- Falls back gracefully if no API key
- Uploads review results as artifact (30-day retention)
- Posts formatted comment on PR with issue summary
- Creates inline review comments for critical issues (up to 20)
- Blocks merge if critical issues found
- Security: Pinned action versions, read-only permissions

**Workflow Steps:**
1. Checkout code with full history
2. Set up Python 3.11
3. Install dependencies (google-generativeai if API key exists)
4. Run Gemini review script
5. Upload review results artifact
6. Format issues for PR comment
7. Post main comment with summary
8. Create inline review comments on code
9. Block merge if critical issues detected

### Testing:
✅ Script works with rule-based fallback (no API key needed)  
✅ Directive loading successful  
✅ JSON output generated correctly  
✅ Exit codes work as expected  
✅ Workflow YAML is valid and ready for PR testing

**Test Results:**
```
Tested with: PR #1 (no actual diff available in test)
Fallback: Rule-based analysis activated
Output: /tmp/test_review.json (valid JSON)
Exit code: 0 (no critical issues in empty diff)
Gemini: Ready to use when API key configured
```

## Phase 4: Theory Evolution System Documentation ✅

### Files Created:
- `docs/THEORY_EVOLUTION_SYSTEM.md` (16KB)

### Implementation Details:

Comprehensive design documentation for a future self-improving theoretical framework.

#### System Components Documented:

1. **Calculation Engine**
   - Automated computation pipeline for all predictions
   - High-precision arithmetic (mpmath)
   - One-to-one theory-code correspondence
   - Extends existing Jupyter notebooks

2. **Validation Module**
   - Compares predictions to experiments (CODATA, PDG, Planck)
   - Calculates relative errors and σ-deviations
   - Categorizes predictions by accuracy
   - Tier 1-4 validation protocols

3. **Error Analyzer**
   - Statistical analysis of error distributions
   - Pattern recognition (systematic offsets, scale dependencies)
   - Correlation analysis across observables
   - Topology-based error categorization

4. **AI Advisor**
   - Suggests theoretical refinements based on error patterns
   - **Constraint:** Only topological/geometric modifications
   - Examples: Higher Chern class corrections, Berry phases, instanton terms
   - **Priority:** Derivation over phenomenology
   - Ranks suggestions by theoretical naturalness

5. **Integration System**
   - Validates proposed refinements comprehensively
   - Ensures no regressions in existing predictions
   - Synoptic integration if validation passes
   - Documents theoretical rationale

#### Implementation Roadmap:
- **Phase 1 (Months 1-2):** Infrastructure - extend notebooks, build database
- **Phase 2 (Months 3-4):** AI Advisor development - prompt engineering, testing
- **Phase 3 (Months 5-6):** Integration system - validation, regression testing
- **Phase 4 (Months 7+):** Full operation - evolution cycles, v27.0 refinements

#### Success Metrics:
- **Primary:** >95% of Tier 1 parameters within 3σ (from >90% baseline)
- **Secondary:** 20% reduction in mean σ-deviation per cycle
- **Quality:** 100% of refinements traceable to topology
- **Efficiency:** <1 week per refinement cycle

#### Safety Mechanisms:
- No-tuning enforcement (all refinements pass Directive A)
- Regression prevention (validate against ALL predictions)
- Symmetry preservation (gauge invariance, Lorentz symmetry)
- Transparency (public version control, peer review)

#### Example Evolution Cycle:
Detailed walkthrough of improving gauge coupling predictions using second Chern class corrections:
- Initial error: α₁, α₂, α₃ all 1-3% too strong
- AI suggestion: Include C₂(G) corrections
- Implementation: New notebook with refinement
- Validation: All couplings improved to <0.5% error
- Integration: Update theory document to v27.0

1. `agent-directive-check.yml` will scan changed files
2. Comments will be posted if violations found
3. Artifacts will be uploaded for review
4. Merge will be blocked if critical violations exist

Optional: Configure `GEMINI_API_KEY` secret for AI-powered reviews

---

## Security Considerations

### Implemented Security Best Practices:

1. **Pinned Action Versions:**
   - All third-party actions pinned to commit SHAs
   - Prevents supply chain attacks via action modifications
   - Examples:
     - `actions/checkout@b4ffde65f46336ab88eb53be808477a3936bae11` (v4.1.1)
     - `actions/setup-python@65d7f2d534ac1bc67fcd62888c5f4f3d2cb2b236` (v4.7.1)

2. **Minimal Permissions:**
   - Workflows use `permissions:` block
   - Prefer `contents: read` over `contents: write`
   - Only grant necessary permissions (e.g., `pull-requests: write` for commenting)

3. **Secret Management:**
   - `GEMINI_API_KEY` stored as repository secret (if configured)
   - Never exposed in logs or outputs
   - Optional: workflow works without it

4. **Input Validation:**
   - Scripts validate all inputs
   - Path traversal prevented
   - JSON parsing with error handling

5. **Artifact Retention:**
   - 30-day retention (not permanent)
   - Contains no secrets
   - Only violation reports and review results
