AI Advisor Module for IRH Theory Evolution System

Phase 2 Implementation: AI-guided theoretical refinement suggestions.

This module provides:
- Prompt engineering for physics-constrained suggestions
- Topological modification templates
- Suggestion ranking algorithms
- Validation that suggestions follow Directive A (topological origin only)

**Critical Constraints (Directive A Compliance):**
- ❌ NO parameter tuning to fit data
- ❌ NO arbitrary scaling factors
- ❌ NO phenomenological formulas
- ✅ ONLY topological/geometric refinements
- ✅ ONLY modifications with clear mathematical origin
- ✅ ONLY changes preserving fundamental symmetries

Usage:
    from evolution_system import AIAdvisor, ErrorAnalyzer, ValidationModule
    
    # Get error analysis
    analyzer = ErrorAnalyzer()
    analysis = analyzer.analyze(validation_report)
    
    # Generate refinement suggestions
    advisor = AIAdvisor()
    suggestions = advisor.generate_suggestions(analysis)
    
    # Rank and filter
    ranked = advisor.rank_suggestions(suggestions)
    topological = advisor.filter_topological_only(ranked)

        This refinement addresses the identified error pattern through

        3. Compute ALL predictions with modification applied
